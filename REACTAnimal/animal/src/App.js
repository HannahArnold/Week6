      <h1>Fennec fox</h1>
      <h2>Vulpes zerda</h2>

      <p>
        The fennec fox, or fennec (Vulpes zerda) or sand fox, is a small
        crepuscular fox found in the Sahara Desert of North Africa, the Sinai
        Peninsula, South East Israel (Arava desert) and the Arabian desert. Its
        most distinctive feature is its unusually large ears, which also serve
        to dissipate heat. Its name comes from the Berber-Arabic word (fanak),
        which means fox. The fennec is the smallest species of canid. Its coat,
        ears, and kidney functions have adapted to high-temperature, low-water,
        desert environments. Also, its hearing is sensitive enough to hear prey
        moving underground. It mainly eats insects, small mammals, and birds.{" "}
        The fennec has a life span of up to 14 years in captivity and about 10
        years in the wild. Its main predators are the African varieties of eagle
        owl, jackals, and other large mammals. Families of fennecs dig out dens
        in the sand for habitation and protection, which can be as large as 120
        m2 (1,292 sq ft) and adjoin the dens of other families. Precise
        population figures are not known but are estimated from the frequency of
        sightings; these indicate that the animal is currently not threatened by
        extinction. Knowledge of social interactions is limited to information
        gathered from captive animals. The species is usually assigned to the
        genus Vulpes; however, this is debated due to differences between the
        fennec fox and other fox species. The fennec's fur is prized by the
        indigenous peoples of North Africa, and in some parts of the world, the
        animal is considered an exotic pet.

      <h3>Etymology</h3>
      <p>
        The word fox comes from Old English, which derived from Proto-Germanic
        *fuhsaz.[nb 1] This in turn derives from Proto-Indo-European *puḱ-,
        meaning ’thick-haired; tail’. Male foxes are known as dogs, tods or
        reynards, females as vixens, and young as cubs, pups, or kits, though
        the latter name is not to be confused with a distinct species called kit
        foxes. Vixen is one of very few words in modern English that retains the
        Middle English southern dialect "v" pronunciation instead of "f" (i.e.
        northern English "fox" versus southern English "vox").A group of foxes
        is referred to as a skulk, leash, or earth.

      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        The fennec fox weighs about 0.7–1.6 kg (1.5–3.5 lb), with a body length
        of between 24–41 cm (9–16 in); it is around 20.3 cm (8 in) tall. A
        fennec Fox has a bushy tail that measures 17–30 centimetres It is the
        smallest species of canid in the world. The tail has a black tip and is
        18–31 cm (7–12 in) long, while the ears can be between 10–15 cm
        (3.9–5.9 in) long. The coat is often a cream colour and fluffy, which
        deflects heat during the day and keeps the fox warm at night. The
        fennec's characteristic ears are the largest among all foxes relative to
        body size, and serve to dissipate heat, as they have many blood vessels
        close to the skin. The ears of a fennec are sensitive enough to hear
        prey that may be underground; the soles of its feet are protected from
        the hot desert sand by thick fur.
